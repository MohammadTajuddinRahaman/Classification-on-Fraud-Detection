# Classification-on-Fraud-Detection
💳 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this critical mini-project on Fraud Detection using machine learning!

📝 Project Overview
In this project, we work with a real-world financial transactions dataset aimed at detecting fraudulent activities. The dataset includes detailed information about each transaction, such as:

Transaction Type

Transaction Amount

Origin and Destination Account Balances

Flags indicating system suspicion or confirmed fraud

The target variable is isFraud, where:

1 = Fraudulent Transaction

0 = Legitimate Transaction

Our goal is to develop a complete machine learning pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation—to accurately classify whether a transaction is fraudulent.

🎯 Objective
The main objective is to build and compare multiple machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions. This is crucial for financial institutions to:

Minimize financial losses

Detect anomalies early

Enhance trust and security within digital banking systems

🤖 Models Evaluated
We evaluate the following classification models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

These models were selected based on their performance and interpretability in fraud classification tasks.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Fraud detection often deals with imbalanced datasets, so evaluation metrics beyond accuracy are critical. We use:

Accuracy – Overall model correctness

Precision – How many predicted frauds were actually fraud (minimizing false positives)

Recall – How many actual frauds were detected (minimizing false negatives)

F1 Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall

Confusion Matrix – Detailed breakdown of prediction results

⚠️ High recall is especially important to reduce missed fraudulent cases.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is built in Python, using:

pandas – Data preprocessing and wrangling

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation metrics

✅ Outcome
By evaluating and comparing the models across all metrics, we aim to:

Select the best-performing model for fraud detection

Understand transaction patterns that indicate potential fraud

Provide actionable insights to improve real-time fraud prevention systems

Help financial institutions safeguard customer data and funds

💡 Thanks for checking out this project! We hope it demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged for better financial security and risk management.
